# Cryptography
Cryptography is like building a secret fort for your information! It's the practice of securing communication to keep it confidential. Imagine special tools and tricks to scramble messages, like ciphers, and then unscramble them only for authorized recipients. 
Cryptography protects our online activities, like online banking and sending messages, by ensuring only the intended person can access the information. 

## Ciphers

A cipher is a secret code! It's a way to transform a readable message into something scrambled and unreadable, like a spy's secret note.  
Think shifting letters in the alphabet (Caesar cipher) or replacing them with symbols. Ciphers are a fun way to explore the world of secret messages and are a building block for cryptography, which keeps our online communication secure.



#### Example cipher
 Δ | 1 | 2 | 3 |  4  | 5
---|---|---|---| --- |---
1  | a | b | c |  d  | e
2  | f | g | h | i/j | k
3  | l | m | n |  o  | p
4  | q | r | s |  t  | u
5  | v | w | x |  y  | z

## AES
The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), also known by its original name Rijndael (Dutch pronunciation: [ˈrɛindaːl]), is a specification for the encryption of electronic data established by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in 2001.
